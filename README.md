## Introduction

**Beyond The Game** is my first assessed portfolio project, developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development for the AI Augmented Developer Bootcamp. This project leverages HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3, and a variety of AI tools, such as DALL-E 3, to create a website focusing on mental health awareness for former athletes.

## Project Outline

Beyond The Game is a fictional organization aimed at spreading mental health awareness among former professional or high-level athletes. The website provides information on common mental health issues and links to external resources. The design focuses on being supportive, organized, mobile-friendly, and responsive.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

1. As a former professional athlete, I want to easily navigate the website to find information on mental health quickly.
2. I want beginner-friendly articles on mental health to understand common issues and management techniques.
3. I need access to resources and tips on managing stress to improve my mental well-being.
4. I want the website to be mobile-accessible for on-the-go access.
5. I want a calming and supportive design to feel comfortable while browsing.
6. I need athlete-specific information for relevant resources and support.

## Design

### Colors

- **Main Palette:**
  - Black (#000000) - Background color
  - White (#FFFFFF) - Text color
  - Gold (#FFD700) - Accent color
  - Light Yellow/Cream (#f2f4cb) - Primary button background
  - Dark Green (#223127) - Button hover color

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created to outline the layout and structure of the website, using Bootstrap v5.3 for component organization.

### Imagery

Images were selected to support a theme of relatability, inclusivity, and relevance to the athletic community:

- **Themes:** Ex-athletes in relatable settings (e.g., locker rooms).
- **Contextual Relevance:** Each image connects to the card topic (e.g., support groups).
- **Inclusivity:** Includes people from various genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds.
- **Consistency:** Images align with the color scheme.

Images were created using DALL-E 3 with prompts like:

- “Create an image of a single athlete contemplating their mental health.”
- “Create an image of ex-athletes in a classroom learning how to code.”

## Testing

Testing was conducted using Chrome Developer Tools throughout development, with validation at the end.

- **HTML Validation:** Checked for errors and accessibility.
- **CSS Validation:** Ensured consistency and adherence to best practices.
- **Lighthouse:** Checked for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO scores.

## Bugs
My lighthouse performance score was 70%. I will change image sizes, and reduce unused CSS to improve the score in the future. Due to a lack of time, this will be a future change and is a "bug" for now. There are other diagnostic errors like "minimize thread work" but I do not understand these for the time being and do not have time to research to change.

## Future Adds
I will add photos to this readme document as there was an issue doing so today. Other additions include:
- Articles to link to about section cards
- Links to relevant external services (left due to ethical implications of not researching and adding sites that will help target audience)
