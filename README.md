View Beyond The Game

Introduction
Beyond The Game is my first assessed portfolio project, developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development for the AI Augmented Developer Bootcamp. This project leverages HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3, and a variety of AI tools, such as DALL-E 3, to create a website focusing on mental health awareness for former athletes.

Project Outline
Beyond The Game is a fictional organization aimed at spreading mental health awareness among former professional or high-level athletes. The website provides information on common mental health issues and links to external resources. The design focuses on being supportive, organized, mobile-friendly, and responsive.

Wireframes
Wireframes were created to outline the layout and structure of the website, using Bootstrap v5.3 for component organization.

Imagery
Images were selected to support a theme of relatability, inclusivity, and relevance to the athletic community:

Themes: Ex-athletes in relatable settings (e.g., locker rooms).
Contextual Relevance: Each image connects to the card topic (e.g., support groups).
Inclusivity: Includes people from various genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds.
Consistency: Images align with the color scheme.
Images were created using DALL-E 3 with prompts like:

“Create an image of a single athlete contemplating their mental health.”
“Create an image of ex-athletes in a classroom learning how to code.”
